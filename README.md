## 📚 Learning Journey & Context

This project is part of my web development learning journey, representing an important milestone:

- Current Stage: Mastering HTML structure and CSS styling fundamentals
- Learning Focus: Static implementation to understand design and layout principles
- Next Steps: JavaScript integration and API consumption
- Goal: Building dynamic, interactive web applications

The static approach allows me to focus on creating clean, responsive designs before adding the complexity of dynamic functionality.
